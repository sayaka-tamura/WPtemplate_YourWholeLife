### Concept  
"Your Whole Life" is a WordPress theme for a blog you and your family can collaborate on the same account's pages.  
You can post your comment or photo to the site as a diary.  
A noteworthy fact of the website is that you could let your family write your diary as one of authors.  
Your parents, wife, husband, child, grand child could be an author.  

For example, when a boy was born, his parent's will become the author of the website.  
After that, when he starts to write the blog by himself, the author is going to change to himself from his parents.  
But his parents are still using the website as one of authors. They can upload an article about him parallel to articles by him.  

If he gets married, his wife also could become the author. His child and grand child too.  
So, the whole of website is created by his family.  
We can see a scene of his life as a blog on the website.  

Let's start to create your and your family's diary here.
